DEPRECATED
==========

The `TinEye Services <https://services.tineye.com/>`_ libraries will not be maintained in the future.
The current recommended best practice is to access the APIs using an HTTP
library native to the language of your choice.
The `TinEye Developer Documentation <https://services.tineye.com/developers/>`_ 
includes interactive code examples for all API calls to help you get started.

TinEye Services API PHP client
=================================

**tineyeservices** is a PHP client library for the MatchEngine, MobileEngine,
MulticolorEngine and WineEngine APIs. MatchEngine, MobileEngine,
MulticolorEngine and WineEngine are general image-matching engines that allow
you to perform large scale image comparisons for a variety of tasks.
See `<https://services.tineye.com/>`_ for more information.

Installation
------------

Download the latest version of the library:

::

    $ wget https://github.com/TinEye/tineyeservices_php/archive/master.zip

and place the ``.php`` files where a PHP ``require`` statement will find them.
That place depends on your particular OS and installation.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation about the use of the library is available from `<https://services.tineye.com/library/php/docs/>`_.
